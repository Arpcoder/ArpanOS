This OS is fully compatible with x64 windows versions.
Maker-Arpan Chatterjee
This is my first OS!
No bugs. It has passed my quality checks. I have checked it and I did not find any bugs. Bugs will only appear if the system crashes, gets corrupt or by your mistake. I have tried my best to make it user-friendly. It uses MS-DOS like commands, but not that hard to remember. I have included the .BAS file of the OS, so that you all can configure it independently. I made it using QB64, and the .BAS file will open in QB64 only! You can inform to me anything about this OS by mailing me at -arpanchatterjee1647@gmail.com .I will give more updates and include more programs in the next update.
